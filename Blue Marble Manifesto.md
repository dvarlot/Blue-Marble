This document is the manifesto of the Blue marble project of Fundatia Ananke. This project has the objective of creating a decentralized community of practice dedicated to sustainability by sharing information and tools, selecting, and executing projects.

# Sustainability is the ultimate challenge for humanity.
Sustainability is a challenge that humanity must face head-on. Unfortunately, despite warnings from scientists and activists, many of us failed to take action. Now, the reality of climate degradation has become impossible to ignore.
In 2015, world leaders recognized the need for a more sustainable way of living. As a result, they established the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. While some progress has been made since the SDGs went into effect in 2016, there is still a long way to go:

- Gender equality risks moving backward, with women's rights being challenged. 
- Poverty continues to be a major issue in many parts of the world. 
- Climate change targets are frequently missed. 
- Leaders and businesspeople talk about equal opportunities without taking action. 
- The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted unequal access to healthcare and vaccines. 
- Girls and women in many parts of the world are denied access to education.

At Fundatia Ananke, we are convinced that People are inherently good and willing to do good. But we need to give them the means to take action. Sustainability is the responsibility of each individual. And working together as a global community is the best way to achieve a sustainable future.
# We need leaders and supporting tools.
Achieving a sustainable way of life is crucial for our survival as a species. But we need leaders to guide us toward this goal. Unfortunately, people’s trust in institutions, governments, and corporations has eroded.

Governments are ill-equipped to take the role of leaders in this matter. Their action is restrained by their frontiers and the next re-election term. On the opposite, tackling sustainability concerns requires a long-term and global vision. 

Corporations are even less equipped to take up the challenge. Their main goal remains the next quarterly profit. As a result, corporations are constrained by the ruling of shareholders, short-term profits, and dividends. 
Few corporations claim to abide by Environment and Social Governance. But unfortunately, these initiatives are often evaluated based on their direct impact on short-term profits.
Neither the government nor corporations have demonstrated a sense of urgency in developing sustainability.

People need tools to support their initiatives. But, Social media posts have a short life and are not designed to promote a concern to the authority that can resolve it. 

At Fundatia Ananke, we are convinced that sustainability is the responsibility of each individual. People must take matters into their own hands and act now. People are the ultimate stakeholders of their future. No one should have to face the challenge of sustainability alone.  
We are committed to promoting a decentralized organization where people can access the tools they need to take action and are empowered to make decisions. 

# Ethical use of technology can empower people.
At Fundatia Ananke, we are convinced that decentralized decision-making is the way forward to enable individuals to decide by and for themselves. Fortunately, technology has advanced enough to allow this breakthrough. Technology is now a liberating tool. It facilitates the creation of organizations where every participant can express their opinions without fear and where decisions are made through consensus, with every voice taken into account.

This new organizational model is called DAO - Decentralized Autonomous Organization. It utilizes blockchain technology to establish a safe and collaborative environment for anyone. For the first time in history, people can make decisions safely and take action. They can be the masters of their own destiny.

DAO changes our relationship with governance. There is no more a small group of elected officials making decisions and imposing them on everyone else. Instead, DAO gives back the power to the people. It is no more in the hands of individuals who serve their own interests. This was the dream of the fathers of all major constitutions in history. And this dream comes true now.
In a DAO, people can decide by consensus which projects are worth pursuing. They can support one another. They collaborate and allocate resources to their chosen projects. A DAO enables the community to benefit from collective wisdom and strength.

# We are committed to creating a decentralized community dedicated to sustainability.
The Blue Marble project of Fundatia Ananke consists in creating an empowered community as a DAO with the supporting toolbox to enable action through the execution of sustainability projects.
This project is in line with the values of Fundatia Ananke:
- Open source and open data: make source code and supporting data available for inspection by the community. Have the training data of AI inspected to avoid bias and protect privacy.
- Open knowledge and open science: The value of knowledge resides in it being shared. A knowledge or a technology kept locked in a drawer is holding back humanity.
- Decentralized organization: this is a mandatory condition to empower people.

We have the vision of a community that is decentralized and empowered and collaborate to build a better future. A community where:
- People can discuss their ideas and proposal freely and without fear;
- The voice of each individual is heard and taken into consideration;
- Concerns are shared and collectively promoted to those who have the power to solve them;
- The community, through consensus, select projects, execute them, and report the outcomes in full transparency;
- The contribution of each individual is welcomed, praised, and rewarded;
- People collaborate on research and technologies safely and transparently;
- Technologies are protected against patent trolls but remain available to whom need them while ensuring a fair remuneration of the contributors;
- People don’t have to take project outcomes at face value but can inspect the supporting data and conclude about the claims’ accuracy.

We design this community and toolbox with strict ethics in mind. We make sure that no unhealthy dependencies or influences are created. We only use artificial intelligence when necessary. And where we do, it is trained on anonymized data to protect the privacy of our users. The training data is available for inspection to ensure that no bias is being introduced.
# We are committed to creating long-term value, not short-term profit
Achieving sustainable living cannot be accomplished in a single day. It requires a long-term vision. In contrast, traditional venture capital prioritizes short-term gains for shareholders at the expense of users. 

Therefore, we have chosen a radically different path. 
Fundatia Ananke is a foundation and operates without shareholders. It can focus on its mission and values. This frees us from the obligation of prioritizing growth at all costs and short-term valuation over a sustainable operation. 

We are free to give back the power to the community, reward the users for their contribution, and provide the right tools in the long run. We are free to progressively decentralize the decision-making to the users to the point where they will have complete control over the community’s strategy and development, including the supporting toolbox. 
We believe that, as soon as possible, each member must have a say in their future and the community’s future.
We are committed to making this a reality quickly. The foundation’s role shall end up limited to being the guardian of the mission and values.
# We are committed to generating a virtuous circle.
Our approach to funding is based on this radically different approach and the perspective of a progressive but fast decentralization.
This approach protects the project from the risk of deviating from its mission and values.
Our fundraising strategy is built to promote long-term value creation by a virtuous circle effect.

To initiate this virtuous circle, the Foundation raises funds as donations both in and outside the blockchain. The raised funds are used to grow the DAO and set up the toolbox. 
Each donator shall receive DAO governance tokens that will allow them to participate in the decision-making.
The donator will have the opportunity to monitor the use of the fund in transparency.
 
When the toolbox generates some revenues (through subscription to premium features), the foundation will pay back to the DAO 120% of the amount initially received.

The DAO, via consensus votes, shall propose, select and execute sustainability projects funded with this amount.
It is expected that each project showing a positive ROI shall give back to the DAO 120% of the funding it received.
It is also expected that the members of the DAO will monitor the use of the funds and will be rewarded for that.

This momentum shall progressively increase the value managed by the DAO and the capacity to take care of projects with more impact. This shall enable the community to develop the sustainability projects of its choice and progressively build its vision of a sustainable future.
