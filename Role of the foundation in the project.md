# Why a Foundation as the legal wrapper?

## What is the role of Fundatia Ananke in the Blue Marble project
The Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a crucial entity in the Blue Marble project in which Fundatia Ananke is vital. As the legal wrapper of the DAO, it ensures that all applicable regulations are complied with and provides legal protection to participants. Furthermore, it acts as the intermediary between the DAO and various authorities and represents the organization in front of interested parties. This particular role shall be reevaluated when the legal status of DAOs has been established in the European and United States laws.

But Fundatia Ananke is more than just a legal wrapper. 
It ensures that the values of the DAO and the foundation are aligned, upheld, and respected. 
It also provides a platform for all sustainability projects that the DAO wishes to promote and execute. 
Additionally, it guarantees that funds are managed in compliance with legal requirements and used solely to fulfill the stated mission or execute selected projects.

As the project management entity of the Blue Marble project, Fundatia Ananke takes its role seriously. 
It organizes the engineering teams, develops the applications and tools the community uses in line with the product strategy document, and deploys the application and tools to the users. It is also the support interface for the users.
Its dedication to the success of the DAO is unwavering, and its contributions play a crucial role in the growth and sustainability of the project.

## Why do we use a foundation as the vehicle for Blue Marble Project
When it comes to the Blue Marble Project, using a foundation as the vehicle is the best way to achieve our long-term vision. This approach has so many advantages that we can’t ignore. 

For starters, there are no shareholders involved, which means there's no pressure for short-term valuation or hyper-growth at the expense of our users and members. We don't have to use vanity indicators or chase the next series of fundraising, either. Instead, this allows us to focus on a long-term profitable and sustainable growth strategy that benefits everyone involved. There's no risk of an aggressive IPO or shareholders taking control of the company and changing the mission.
Another great advantage of using a foundation is that we can raise funds from donors aligned with our values and vision. These individuals trust us to develop a positive momentum and help us bring resilience to the project. As a result, we’re free to put our values first and prioritize our users above all else. 
This gives us the freedom, but also the obligation, to live by our values and mission.

We firmly believe that our users and their data are not the product but rather the blood of our community. We're always committed to protecting their privacy and are free to think outside the box and challenge the status quo. We can even pay our users for their contributions, even if it means a cost. We're free to set a benchmark for open data and open source and challenge the old and corrupted patent system.

Perhaps most importantly, using a foundation allows us to ensure ethical development. We can progressively make the community the system’s owner and decentralize all decision-making about the tools and platform and how to manage the data entrusted to us by our members. 
We're free to impose transparency in all aspects of the project, providing accountability that is missing in usual Web 2.0 applications.

In conclusion, the foundation is the perfect vehicle to empower the Blue Marble Project to reach its long-term goals.
We're passionate about this approach because it allows us to prioritize our users, members, and their values above all else. We're free to develop a sustainable growth strategy that benefits everyone involved while challenging the status quo and setting a new standard for ethical development. 
Join us on this exciting journey and help us create a better future!
