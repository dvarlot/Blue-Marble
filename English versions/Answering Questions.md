## Why is it named Blue Marble?
***The Blue Marble*** is a photograph of Earth taken on December 7, 1972, from a distance of around 29,000 kilometers (18,000 miles) from the planet's surface. Taken by the crew of the Apollo 17 spacecraft on its way to the Moon, it is one of the most reproduced images in history.
To the astronauts, the slightly gibbous Earth had the appearance and size of a glass marble, hence the name.

This photograph made people understand that our planet’s resources are limited and must be protected.
## Why are we launching on June 21?
June 21 is the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere. The summer solstice marks the most extended period of daylight in the calendar year, as well as the official beginning of summer.
The Ancient Greek celebration of this date as the Kronia festival marked a momentary freedom from class restraints where enslaved people and lords celebrated together to mimic Kronos’  “Golden Age” of equality and peace.
It is a perfectly logical date to celebrate decentralization and sustainability.
## Why are we making the Blue Marble project?
> Because Sustainability is the ultimate challenge for humanity.

As a global community, we are facing a critical sustainability challenge that requires urgent and unwavering attention. The warnings of scientists cannot be ignored any longer, and the consequences of inaction are too dire to contemplate. 
We must recognize that the erosion of trust in our institutions and leaders is a significant obstacle to progress. The younger generations are feeling disillusioned and let down by the media, governments, and corporations, and this has led to a loss of faith in our collective ability to effect change.
It is imperative that we adopt a new approach that places the needs of the planet and its inhabitants at the forefront, ahead of short-term profits and personal gain. We need to challenge the status quo and take bold steps to ensure a sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.
## What problem does Blue Marble try to solve?
People want a more sustainable lifestyle and to make an impact but don't know where to start. Blue Marble's decentralized autonomous community allows individuals to collaborate on sustainability projects, creating a more sustainable way of life and business practices. So that people can be proud of the positive impact they have on the world and of the legacy they will leave for future generations
