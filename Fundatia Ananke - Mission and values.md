# Our Values

At Ananke Foundation, we firmly believe in the power of an open mind. Our commitment to questioning our beliefs and remaining receptive to new ideas allows us to challenge the status quo. We see opportunities where others see obstacles, and we are unafraid to be the round peg in a square hole. Our unwavering confidence in our approach enables us to achieve our ultimate goal of effecting positive change in the world.

We are also strong believers in open-source technology. We believe that by openly sharing knowledge, skills, and resources, we can collaborate and work towards a fair and sustainable future that benefits everyone. The beauty of open source is that it encourages the contribution of the whole community. Everyone has the equal opportunity to share their unique perspectives and insights, which leads to a more diverse and inclusive approach to problem-solving.
One of the key benefits of open source is transparency. With open source, there is no hidden agenda or proprietary ownership. Everyone has equal access to the information they need to make informed decisions.

Transparency is not just a value we hold at our foundation, itâ€™s a cornerstone of our community. We are convinced that everyone deserves access to information about how decisions are made, and resources are allocated. By doing so, we empower our community to trust in our processes and collaborate with us.

At Fundatia Ananke, we firmly believe that knowledge and science must be accessible to all individuals, regardless of their socio-economic status or geographical location. We are committed to ensuring that every individual has equal access to the resources and tools necessary to create positive change within their communities.
By sharing knowledge and ideas openly, we create a more transparent and fair environment for innovation, where everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute their expertise and creativity. 

Open knowledge and science are critical components in building a society that values education and truth. By providing open access to knowledge, we can help bridge the gap between individuals who may not have access to education. This can lead to greater opportunities and a more informed and engaged population.

Additionally, open science can help combat fake science and disinformation by providing a platform for peer-reviewed research and data sharing. This allows for greater transparency and accountability within the community, ensuring that only the most accurate and reliable information is disseminated.

Most importantly, at the heart of our values is the belief in open and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). We are convinced that by spreading decision-making power and responsibility, we can create more resilient and adaptable systems.
DAOs provide a safer organization for individuals as they are not subject to the whims of a single authority figure. The decentralized nature of DAOs ensures that all members have an equal say in decision-making and are protected from any form of coercion. 

We believe DAOs are the perfect form of organization to support sustainability and fight against lack of action. With their decentralized nature, transparent and democratic decision-making process, and sustainable technology, DAOs provide a safe, resilient, and democratic system that can respond to the needs of people and the planet.

At Fundatia Ananke, we are proud to be at the forefront of this movement toward open source, open knowledge, and decentralization of organizations. We believe that by working together, we can create a brighter future for all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances.  

So, whether you are a developer, a user, or simply someone who is passionate about creating positive change, we invite you to join us on this journey toward a better tomorrow.
